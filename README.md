## Usage

LogoCraft is a command-line tool that prompts users to choose a shape (circle, square, or triangle), enter a text of three characters for the logo, and specify text and shape colors. The generated SVG logo is then saved to the /examples folder.

To run LogoCraft, use the following command:

node index.js

Then follow the promts to select a shape and enter your selected colors.

## Tests
LogoCraft includes a set of tests to ensure the correct rendering of shapes. These tests use Jest, a JavaScript testing framework.

To run the tests, use the following command:

npm test
